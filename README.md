# esp8266RelayControllerWithUI
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to control four relays via a web interface. Each relay can be toggled on or off using the web dashboard, which is accessible through both Access Point (AP) mode and Station mode (Wi-Fi connection). The system also allows configuration of Wi-Fi credentials and IP settings through the web interface.
